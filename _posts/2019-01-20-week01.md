title: Week1 - Intro to Open Source
author: Jody

I decided to audit a class this semester called [Open Source Software Development](https://joannakl.github.io/ossd_s19). This will give me a chance to pick and choose the most fun parts of the class, without worry about my grades. As the semester progresses, I will update this blog with the parts of the course that I consider to be the most fun!  
### What does OSSD mean to me?  
OSSD embodies the idea that source code is publicly available where it can be accessed, modified or enhanced. It incorporates a plethora of things including transparency, collaboration, control and creativity. OSSD allows for varying problems in a particular software or application to be solved because it makes use of a larger and more multi-disciplined community. Due to these qualities, OSSD to me represents potential in constant motion.  
## Fun Stuff
The fun part I choose this week was setting up this blog. Everyone in the class already has a repository where all that needs to be done is to create content in the ***\_posts/*** folder on a weekly basis. Setting up a jekyll blog is rather easy if you follow the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), the harder part for me is the design. I will update the design as I go along. I might implement a template later on if my design attempts utterly fail, but for now I will try my hand at designing my own blog template.
