		<h2><a href="/2019/01/20/week01.html">Week1 - Intro to Open Source</a></h2>
		<p><p>I decided to audit a class this semester called <a href="https://joannakl.github.io/ossd_s19">Open Source Software Development</a>. This will give me a chance to pick and choose the most fun parts of the class, without worry about my grades. As the semester progresses, I will update this blog with the parts of the course that I consider to be the most fun!</p>
<h3 id="what-does-ossd-mean-to-me">What does OSSD mean to me?</h3>
<p>OSSD embodies the idea that source code is publicly available where it can be accessed, modified or enhanced. It incorporates a plethora of things including transparency, collaboration, control and creativity. OSSD allows for varying problems in a particular software or application to be solved because it makes use of a larger and more multi-disciplined community. Due to these qualities, OSSD to me represents potential in constant motion.</p>
<h2 id="fun-stuff">Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>The fun part I choose this week was setting up this blog. Everyone in the class already has a repository where all that needs to be done is to create content in the <strong><em>_posts/</em></strong> folder on a weekly basis. Setting up a jekyll blog is rather easy if you follow the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">documentation</a>, the harder part for me is the design. I will update the design as I go along. I might implement a template later on if my design attempts utterly fail, but for now I will try my hand at designing my own blog template.</p>
